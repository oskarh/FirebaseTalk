# FirebaseTalk
Example app I live programmed during my presentation for the GDG Android Meetup group in Stockholm at Expressen.

The app shows how to implement [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), using [FirebaseUI](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android), and [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) to create an app with account management and chat in less than 150 lines of code.

If you want to run the app you need to create a project in Firebase, enable authentication using email / password and add the `google-services.json` file to the project.
